# Low Learning Rate Configuration
# Purpose: Very stable learning, slow but steady
# Good for: Large datasets, avoiding oscillations

train:
  epochs: 200                # Need more epochs with low LR
  batch_size: 64             # Larger batch for stability

# Expected results:
# - Slow but stable learning
# - Unlikely to diverge
# - Better long-term convergence
