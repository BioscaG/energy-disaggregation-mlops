# Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a complete machine learning system for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), with a strong focus on the full MLOps workflow rather than only on training a model. NILM is the task of breaking down the total electricity consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances using only the aggregated mains signal. Instead of installing smart plugs for each device, the system learns typical usage patterns of appliances directly from historical power data. In this project, the main objective is not to achieve state-of-the-art performance, but to design a clear, reproducible, and well-structured end-to-end pipeline that reflects real-world machine learning practices and satisfies the goals of the MLOps course.

At the beginning, the project will use data from the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity Dataset (UK-DALE). This dataset contains detailed electricity measurements from several UK households, including both the total household consumption and appliance-level power readings. To keep the scope manageable and ensure that experiments remain reproducible, only a subset of the dataset will be used. The project will focus on a single household (for example house_1), a small number of appliances such as a fridge, kettle, and washing machine, and a limited time period covering several days or weeks. The mains signal will be resampled to a one-minute resolution, and all appliance signals will be aligned in time with the aggregate consumption. The learning problem will be formulated as supervised time-series learning, where the input is a sliding window of recent aggregate power values and the output is either the power consumption of a specific appliance or a binary on/off state.

In terms of models, the project will start with simple baseline approaches to establish reference performance. These include basic statistical predictors such as mean or persistence models, as well as simple threshold-based classifiers for detecting whether an appliance is on or off. On top of these baselines, a lightweight deep learning model suitable for time-series data will be implemented. The main candidate models are Temporal Convolutional Networks (1D CNNs) or recurrent neural networks based on GRU or LSTM units. These models are well-suited for capturing temporal patterns in electricity consumption while remaining reasonably simple and interpretable. The emphasis of the project will be on comparing models in a systematic and reproducible way, rather than pushing for maximum accuracy.
